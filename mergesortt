DIVIDE AND CONQUER ALGG (divide,conquer and merge)
stable algg
thera(n log n)time but takes O(n) auxillary space
well suited for linked lists. works in O(1) aux space
used in EXTERNAL SORTING
python uses timsort(merge sort+ insertion sort variation)

ex:merge 2 sorted arrays
a[]= {10,15,20,20} m=4
b[]= {1,12}        n=2

after 1st loop : c[]={10,15,20,20,_,_}
after 2nd loop : c[]={10,15,20,20,1,12}
